                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    This is the site you are currently on, for me it was the first project where I used JavaScript, Node.js, Git, GitHub and Bash. During the studying, I had to make a portfolio project and use in it all the skills that I learned during the studying.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    While working, I used the MacOs system, wrote code in the Visual Studio Code program. The programming languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used in this project. For processing photos and pictures I used Photshop program. In this project, I used the Bash console, in it I used Git to make commits, Node.js to check the work of JavaScript codes, and also to publish the site on GitHub. And used Google Chrome Dev Tools, to test the site's performance.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Process</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    To begin with, I drew wireframes, this wasn't hard for me, because for many months I have been imagining what my portfolio site would look like.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The site was made with a simple scheme, first I assembled the bones, added style to them, then added movement to the site using CSS and JavaScript, and at the end proceeded to adjust/corrections.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The site is made simply, it consists of one page, the page has a sections of navigation and content. The site consists of 4 sectors, about me, projects, blog and contacts. At the very beginning, the sector “about” is activated, if the user moves to another sector, then the activated sector disappears, this was done using the JavaScript [onclick] method. In different sectors there are buttons that redirect to other sectors, there are buttons that direct to other sites (social media, projects) and a button through which you can send an email to the site owner. When clicking on a project in the blog sector, a back button will appear that will be glued to the user's screen so that the user can return to the blog sector anywhere on the screen. The site has a different look, when the screen is compressed, for example, when compressing in which the words in the navigator no longer fit, the words disappear and a navigation button appears, it is glued to the screen position, when you click on it, a menu will open where you can find buttons with special sectors. The menu is closed if the user presses the button to close the menu or if the user enters another sector. The [.getElementById] functions were used for the buttons and the [onclick] activator was used to make them work. Also in the projects menu, if the user swipes over the project logo, the logo will be replaced by another logo with changed colours, this was also done using [.getElementById] and the activator [onmouseover, onmouseout].
                                    <br><br>
                                    A lot of different things have also been added to the head, for example, when sharing a site on a smartphone, the link will have important fact-finding information like a photo, a mini-text about the company. Also, the site has a theme color and an icon working on the iOS platform, etc.
                                    <br><br>
                                    At the end, the site was published on GitHub, you can see the content and commits by clicking on the <a href="https://github.com/iNalsur/inalsur.github.io" target=”_blank” style="color: #722F37; font-weight: bold;">link</a>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    I was very satisfied with the site, it turned out to be the way I imagined it, I got a lot of experience and continued my education.

                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    This is my first big project that I did for my friend entrepreneur. During my studying in Codecademy, I needed to make a project called “Company Home Page” using the Flexbox method to understand how the site changes when the screen is resized.
                                    <br><br>
                                    During the task, I could use a fictitious company, but I preferred to do a project for an existing company, as this would help me gain experience with working with a client as well.
                                    <br><br>
                                    To view the site, click on the logo or click on this <a href="https://tjhmetsuri.fi/" target=”_blank” style="color: #722F37; font-weight: bold;">link</a>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    While working, I used the MacOs system, wrote code in the Visual Studio Code program. The programming languages HTML and CSS were used in this project. For processing photos and pictures I used Photshop and WebP Converter. For the first release, I used GitHub, unfortunately at that moment I was not familiar with the work of Git, because of this I did not use commits. Using Google Chrome Dev Tools, I tested the site's performance.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Process</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    After I discussed the details with a friend/client, I got to work.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I first drew the wireframes and after that discussed it again with a friend/client, after we were satisfied I got to work writing the site.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The site is made simply, it consists of one page, the page has a sections of navigation, content and footer. The site consists of 3 sectors, introduction with the company, introduction with the work and contact information. Also in different sectors there are buttons that redirect the user to special sectors on the website, there are also buttons that redirect to other sites (social media), a button through which you can immediately call the entrepreneur, and also a button through which you can immediately send an email message to the entrepreneur. The site has a different look, when the screen is resized, for example, on a tablet, the words in the navigation disappear and icons appear instead, the long name of the company becomes short. In the sector with introduction with the company, the photo on the left side goes to the center, and the text on the right side lies on the photo, and for the phone version, a lot of things change as well. For this, was used the code in CSS [@media only screen and…].
                                    <br><br>
                                    A lot of different things have also been added to the head, for example, when sharing a site on a smartphone, the link will have important fact-finding information like a photo, a mini-text about the company. Also, the site has a theme color and an icon for home screen on the iOS platform, etc.
                                    <br><br>
                                    At the end, the site was shown to a friend / client, after which we found a hosting hotel together, a friend bought a domain address and I helped him set up the site to work on his own domain (this was my first experience).
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    A friend/client and I were satisfied with the result, I got a lot of experience and continued studying.
